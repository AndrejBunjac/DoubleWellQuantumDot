# DoubleWellQuantumDot

A very robust code to calculate the energy levels of a double well quantum dots currently without Coulomb Interaction which is to be implemented.
The various indices in the nested for loops represent different quantum numbers in play and could have been written as a single loop but the plurality is kept
for readabilitiy in terms of quantum numbers.
